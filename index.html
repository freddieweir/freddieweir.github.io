				<h2 class="is-size-5">Bio</h2>
				<p>I am a "born abroad" American citizen from the tropical island of Jamaica,
					having lived in the West Indies, Asia, and Northern America. I have
					always been able to quickly adapt to new environments with enthusiasm
					as I grew up, acquiring excellent soft skills that I knew would be
					beneficial to my future career. Throughout my life, my passion for
					technology has always been a prevalent part of who I am and led me to
					where I am today. </p>

			  <p>Since my first time hearing of cloud computing services back in high
					school, I have always believed in the future of the cloud with the
					understanding that these technologies would one day, fundamentally
					change the business world as we knew it. Over time, my confidence in
					the cloud turned into unwavering passion and in 2019, finally
					experienced cloud services for myself with my first certification.
					Since then, I knew that my career future would be tied to the cloud
					as I continue to acquire enough experience to eventually become an
					expert in all things cloud. </p>
